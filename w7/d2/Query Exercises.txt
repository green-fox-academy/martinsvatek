Some reviewers didn't provide a date with their rating. Find the names of all reviewers who have ratings with a NULL value for the date. 
SELECT name FROM reviewer JOIN rating ON reviewer.rID = rating.rID WHERE ratingdate IS NULL;

---

Write a query to return the ratings data in a more readable format: reviewer name, movie title, stars, and ratingDate. Also, sort the data, first by reviewer name, then by movie title, and lastly by number of stars. 
SELECT reviewer.name, movie.title, rating.stars, rating.ratingdate
FROM rating
LEFT JOIN movie ON rating.mID = movie.mID // connection from left
LEFT JOIN reviewer ON rating.rID = reviewer.rID // connection from left
ORDER BY reviewer.name, movie.title, rating.stars; // sorting

---

For all cases where the same reviewer rated the same movie twice and gave it a higher rating the second time, return the reviewer's name and the title of the movie.
